# Fix Linting and Type Errors

Run the linter and TypeScript compiler to find and fix all errors.

## Instructions

1. Run `npm run lint` to check for ESLint issues
2. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for TypeScript errors
3. Fix each error in order of severity
4. Re-run checks after fixes to verify
5. Report a summary of issues found and fixed

Prioritize type errors over style issues. Do not disable ESLint rules unless absolutely necessary.
