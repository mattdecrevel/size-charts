# Run Tests and Fix Issues

Run the test suite and fix any failing tests.

## Instructions

1. First run `npm run test:run` to execute unit tests
2. If tests fail, analyze the error output and fix the issues
3. Re-run tests after each fix to verify
4. If all unit tests pass, run `npm run test:e2e` for E2E tests
5. Report a summary of what was fixed

Focus on fixing the actual bugs rather than modifying tests to pass unless the test itself is incorrect.
