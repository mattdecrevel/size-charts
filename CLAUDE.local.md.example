# Local Claude Configuration (Example)

This file is for your personal Claude Code settings. Copy this to `CLAUDE.local.md` to use.

The `CLAUDE.local.md` file is gitignored and lets you add personal preferences without affecting the team.

## Example Personal Preferences

```markdown
## My Preferences

- I prefer verbose explanations when debugging
- Always show the full command before running it
- Use tabs instead of spaces (my editor converts them)

## My Environment

- Running on macOS with Homebrew
- Using pnpm instead of npm: replace `npm` with `pnpm`
- Local Postgres runs on port 5433

## Current Focus

Working on the admin panel redesign. Key files:
- `components/admin/size-chart-editor/`
- `app/(app)/admin/size-charts/`
```

## Usage

1. Copy this file: `cp CLAUDE.local.md.example CLAUDE.local.md`
2. Edit with your preferences
3. The file is automatically gitignored
